    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
      SQL Injection occurs when user input is improperly handled in database queries.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>More details</summary>
      <p>
        SQL Injection is one of the most well-known and dangerous web vulnerabilities.
        It happens when an application directly inserts user input into SQL queries
        without proper validation or sanitization.

        <br><br>
        Attackers can use SQL Injection to bypass authentication mechanisms,
        access sensitive user data, modify records, or even completely delete databases.
        In some cases, attackers may gain administrative access to the system.

        <br><br>
        Common causes include dynamic SQL queries, lack of input validation,
        and poor database access controls. This vulnerability mainly affects
        applications that interact with relational databases.

        <br><br>
        The best prevention methods are using prepared statements,
        parameterized queries, stored procedures, and strict input validation.
        Applying the principle of least privilege to database users
        also greatly reduces the impact of successful attacks.

    <h2>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
    <p>
      XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>More details</summary>
      <p>
        Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities appear when an application
        displays user-supplied input without proper output encoding.
        As a result, malicious JavaScript code can be executed
        inside a victim's browser.

        <br><br>
        XSS attacks are commonly used to steal session cookies,
        capture keystrokes, manipulate web content, or redirect users
        to phishing pages. This vulnerability directly affects users,
        not the server itself.

        <br><br>
        There are different types of XSS attacks including
        Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS.
        Each type has different attack vectors but similar impacts.

        <br><br>
        Preventing XSS requires proper output encoding,
        input validation, and implementing security headers
        such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP).

    <h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>
    <p>
      CSRF forces users to perform unwanted actions without their consent.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>More details</summary>
      <p>
        CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a web application has in a user’s browser.
        When a user is authenticated, malicious requests can be sent without
        the user knowing or approving the action.

        <br><br>
        For example, attackers can force users to change passwords,
        transfer money, or modify account settings.
        These attacks rely on active user sessions.

        <br><br>
        CSRF vulnerabilities are common in applications
        that do not verify the origin of requests.

        <br><br>
        Effective prevention techniques include anti-CSRF tokens,
        checking request headers, and using SameSite cookie attributes.

    <h2>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</h2>
    <p>
      RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>More details</summary>
      <p>
        Remote Code Execution is considered a critical vulnerability
        because it can give attackers full control over a system.

        <br><br>
        Attackers may exploit insecure file uploads, command injections,
        or outdated software components to execute malicious commands.

        <br><br>
        Once successful, attackers can steal data, install malware,
        create backdoors, or use the server for further attacks.

        <br><br>
        Preventing RCE requires strict input validation,
        disabling unnecessary system functions,
        regular patching, and sandboxing risky processes.

    <h2>Security Misconfiguration</h2>
    <p>
      Poor configuration settings can expose systems to attacks.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>More details</summary>
      <p>
        Security Misconfiguration happens when systems are deployed
        with insecure default settings or mismanaged permissions.

        <br><br>
        Examples include open admin panels, default passwords,
        exposed error messages, and unnecessary open ports.

        <br><br>
        Attackers often scan systems specifically for misconfigurations
        because they are easy to exploit.

        <br><br>
        Regular security audits, proper hardening procedures,
        and minimal service exposure are the best defenses.
