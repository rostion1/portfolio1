                I am a second-year student at ASOIU, specializing in Cyber Security.
                I am highly motivated and passionate about learning new technologies,
                improving my skills, and gaining practical experience in the field
                of information security.

                I enjoy solving problems, exploring innovative ideas, and working in
                collaborative environments. My goal is to continuously grow as a
                cybersecurity professional and contribute to secure and reliable systems.
